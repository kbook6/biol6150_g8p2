Project 2: Read Mapping Lab

Created in Jupyter Notebooks from starter code provided by the BIOS4150/BIOL6150 Professor and TAs

We further analyzed our fastqc file from Project 1 by comparing it to a reference genome and aligning it to the reference. We also evaluated the file we created.

Code of note:
